XSS testing is based on the response testing.

It could be three main types of defence:
1) Length limit
2) Sanitazation
3) Black listing.

Other uncommon methods of xss:

1) Trying modyfing the request method
2) XSS via cookie
3) Via the referrer header
4) Span between two params (/* */)
5) XSS via the uploaded files
6) DOM-based: test each URL-param.
